Dear colleague,
we write to you about your recent preprint in subject. We note that your paper does not properly recognize the role of Advanced Virgo and/or of the Virgo Collaboration to Gravitational Wave science.

For example, you write: ...

A biased narrative of the scientific developments can produce detrimental effects, both in the short and in the long term. It affects the work of hundreds of people working within the Virgo collaboration. A proper recognition of our role can also affect future funding of the field in Europe.

Therefore we kindly ask you to have a second look at your paper and consider rephrasing it in the highlighted parts. We are of course open to discuss this with you. Should you choose to do so, please reply to this message.

Best regards,

Livia Conti, the Virgo Outreach coordinator

Pierre-Francois Cohadon, Virgo Outreach co-coordinator
