Dear colleague,
we write to you about your recent preprint in subject. We note that your
paper does not properly recognize the role of Advanced Virgo and/or of the
Virgo Collaboration to Gravitational Wave science.

For example, in line....

A biased narrative of the scientific developments can produce detrimental
effects, both in the short and in the long term. It affects the work of
hundreds of people working within the Virgo collaboration. A proper
recognition of our role can also affect future funding of the field in
Europe.

Therefore we kindly ask you to have a second look at your paper and
consider rephrasing it in the highlighted parts. We are of course open to
discuss this with you. Should you choose to do so, please reply to this
message.

Best regards,

Livia Conti, the Virgo Outreach coordinator

Pierre-Francois Cohadon, Virgo Outreach co-coordinator

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br><br>Dear colleague,<br>we write to =
you about your recent preprint in subject. We note that your paper does not=
 properly recognize the role of Advanced Virgo and/or of the Virgo Collabor=
ation to Gravitational Wave science.<br><br>For example, in line....<br><br=
>A biased narrative of the scientific developments can produce detrimental =
effects, both in the short and in the long term. It affects the work of hun=
dreds of people working within the Virgo collaboration. A proper recognitio=
n of our role can also affect future funding of the field in Europe.<br><br=
>Therefore we kindly ask you to have a second look at your paper and consid=
er rephrasing it in the highlighted parts. We are of course open to discuss=
 this with you. Should you choose to do so, please reply to this message.<b=
r><br>Best regards,<br><br>Livia Conti, the Virgo Outreach coordinator<br><=
br>Pierre-Francois Cohadon, Virgo Outreach co-coordinator</div>
